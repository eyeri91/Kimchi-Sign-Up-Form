## What I mainly focused

As a consumer myself, It hasnâ€™t always been a pleasant experience when signing in to some websites. Having red colored error messages hurriedly appearing on the screen can be very overwhelming.

Therefore, this project was designed sorely in a customer-oriented perspective, delivering the most positive user experience possible. A sign up form should contribute keeping future customers, not losing them.

To acheive this, there are some points that I followed.

1. _Do not show any invalid message until user leaves to the next input field._\\

   Any alert messages appeared hastly only give stress to users. In that sense, I tried to display any negative feedback at last.

2. _Use the least techincal terms in error messages._\\

   As most of users are not tech-oriented, it is important to let them know what went wrong in a easy and simple manner.

3. _Show password rules right away._\\

   It became such a hassle to create a long and complicated but also valid passwords for web sites these days. It is important to show the guildline and help them to meet requirements.

4._ Help them by showing templates._\\

For example, some input fields can have placeholder filled with valid form of data so that users can have an idea of how to complete each section.

## About

This form checks:

- the length of first name and last name of a user.
- the validity of an email address including the length of a top-level domain.
- a phone number of a user in a form either with or without '-' between numbers.
- a password that must include one of each upper case letter, lower case letter, number and special charactors.
- a password confirmation to check if a user typed password correctly.
